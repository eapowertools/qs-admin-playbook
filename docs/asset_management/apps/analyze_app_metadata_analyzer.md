Benefits:

  - Visibility/standardization of data models (e.g., gating mechanism to Prod)
  - Optimization of data models
  - Load balancing visibility/validation
  
-------------------------

## Goal
{:.no_toc}
Leveraging the [App Metadata Analyzer](../../tooling/app_metadata_analyzer.md) enables the following:
  - Insight into the composition of all data models across an entire Qlik site.
  - Visibility into what apps have synthetic keys, data islands, and circular references.
  - Understanding of application's base RAM footprints--which allows for sizing/load balancing considerations.
  - Indicators of what fields could be dropped/optimized by clearly displaying their size/proportion of the application.
  - Ability to apply thresholds at the appliaction level such as: total records, total number of fields, total number of tables, disk size, etc -- allowing one to employ gating-like mechanisms to ensure data modeling standards and best practices across the site.
